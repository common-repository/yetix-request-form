Zendesk® is a registered trademark of Zendesk Inc.
You need to have a Zendesk account to use this plugin.

With Yetix Request Form you can easily:

*  use a Gutenberg block or a shortcode to include your form where you want in your site

Create your own request form based on default fields or/and your custom fields, created into your Zendesk’s settings.
Define the behaviour and the timeout after the user has filled out the form (stay in the same page or go to another page).


Yetix Request Form adopts the design choices made by your theme. If your theme doesn’t have any style for forms, we added some "basic Classes" to prevent any troubles.

*  Automatic spam protection (without captcha).
